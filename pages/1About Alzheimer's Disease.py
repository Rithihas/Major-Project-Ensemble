- ##### Scientists do not yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer's disease. There likely is not a single cause but rather several factors that can affect each person differently.            
- ##### Age is the best known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.
- ##### Family historyâ€”researchers believe that genetics may play a role in developing Alzheimer's disease. However, genes do not equal destiny. A healthy lifestyle may help reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Two large, long term studies indicate that adequate physical activity, a nutritious diet, limited alcohol consumption, and not smoking may help people.
- ##### Changes in the brain can begin years before the first symptoms appear.
- ##### There is growing scientific evidence that healthy behaviors, which have been shown to prevent cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, may also reduce risk for subjective cognitive decline.
